         <h2>Who are we looking for?</h2>
         <p>

         <h2>Our Profession</h2>
         <p>
            Testers check product quality before it reaches the end user. Does it work? Does it break? Is it user-friendly?
            Those kinds of things. Everything we find is reported back to the product designers so improvements can be made.
            Software testing is an integral part of the software development process.
            Below is a video of one of our automated tests.
         </p>

         <p>
            Our team writes scripts to automate website testing. Every action a user can perform in a browser, we script.
            This is an example of such a test.
            <br><br>
            On the left side of the screen, you see the script running, and on the right side, you see how the script
            interacts with the client’s website. During execution, the script continuously checks whether the site responds
            correctly and whether the data in the browser is accurate.
